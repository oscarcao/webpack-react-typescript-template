## FAQs

### Why use this template over a well established framework like Next.js?

As the name suggests. This is a GitHub template, that allows you to create a new GitHub repo based on this template. It is not a framework and will not be a framework.

The goal of this template repo is to remove the repeatitive aspect of having to setup all the common configuration associated with starting a new React project from scratch.

A framework on the other hand, aims to provide you with an additional layer of abstraction - in layman terms, provide you with additional features and functionality, so you can achieve more while doing less.

### Why is routing not included?

Three reasons:

1) Not all projects require routing. 
2) Routing does not require configuration as it's not a tool per se.
3) Routing is very specific to a project. Putting sample routes in place will only clutter up the template.

### Why is styling not included?

Different people/organisations prefer different styling approaches. It's much easier and cleaner to not have to do rework.

### Is there a template for those who prefer to use standard JavaScript?

Yes. I also have a [Webpack/React template repo](https://github.com/oscarcao/webpack-react-template) on GitHub.
